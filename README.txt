-= About =-

- Module "DFAinclusion.py" contains all the functionality related to defining DFAs, operations on DFAs, 
  and functionality for checking language inclusion of DFAs etc.
- Module "Enforcer.py" contains implementation of predictive enforcement algorithm.
- The directory tests/ contains some examples/tests. These examples illustrate how to define DFAs (phi and psi), 
  and invoking enforcer with some input sequences.      

-= INSTALLATION =-

1. Install python.

-= USAGE =-

and you can invoke each script in this directory. 
For example if test1.py is under the directory /tests, you can invoke it using command "python test1.py".

2. If you prepare more tests/examples, please add them under /tests directory. 
Please see one of the examples in /tests directory to follow how to define intended DFAs, how to invoke the enforcer method etc.
